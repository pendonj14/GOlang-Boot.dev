The defer keyword is a fairly unique feature of Go. It allows a function to be executed automatically just before its enclosing function returns. The deferred call's arguments are evaluated immediately, but the function call is not executed until the surrounding function returns.

Deferred functions are typically used to clean up resources that are no longer being used. Often to close database connections, file handlers and the like.

For example:

func GetUsername(dstName, srcName string) (username string, err error) {
// Open a connection to a database
conn, \_ := db.Open(srcName)

    // Close the connection *anywhere* the GetUsername function returns
    defer conn.Close()

    username, err = db.FetchUser()
    if err != nil {
    	// The defer statement is auto-executed if we return here
    	return "", err
    }

    // The defer statement is auto-executed if we return here
    return username, nil

}

In the above example, the conn.Close() function is not called here:

defer conn.Close()

It's called:

// here
return "", err
// or here
return username, nil

Depending on whether the FetchUser function errored. (We'll cover errors later).

Defer is a great way to make sure that something happens before a function exits, even if there are multiple return statements, a common occurrence in Go.

Multiple Defers
The location of a defer statement inside a function matters. The deferred call is registered at the point where defer is executed, and it will run when the function returns. If you have multiple defer statements in a single function, they are executed in last-in, first-out order (the last deferred call runs first).

For example, you'd want to close a file before trying to remove it:

func CreateTempFile() {
f, \_ := os.Create("temp-42.txt")
defer os.Remove(f.Name()) // executed second
defer f.Close() // executed first

    fmt.Fprintln(f, "How many roads must a man walk down?")

}

Assignment
Complete the bootup function.

Be sure to print the following string just before the bootup function returns:
TEXTIO BOOTUP DONE

Use defer so that you only have to write this message once instead of before each return statement. The message should be printed on its own newline.
